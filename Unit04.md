**Unit 4: General Polynomial Functions** <span id="4"></span> 
*Having been introduced to first-power (linear) and second-power
(quadratic) forms, you are now ready to approach general polynomial
equations and functions. Polynomials are expressions that are made up of
sums and differences of terms, such that the coefficients are all real
numbers and the exponents on the variables are all whole numbers. This
unit begins with an introduction to polynomials in one variable,
stressing the degree (highest power) and what the degree may imply about
a polynomial function’s solutions. You will learn to perform basic
operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing) on
polynomial expressions and how to apply these operations to the
composition of functions. You will learn how to graph polynomial
functions and end the unit with a fairly detailed method for finding all
the roots (solutions) of a polynomial.*  

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 7 hours and 45 minutes.

**4.1 Introduction to Polynomials** <span id="4.1"></span> 
*The most common of all functions that are used in the scientific and
business communities today are polynomials. This is because they are
easy to use and have centuries of study upon them. Polynomials are
single terms or sums and differences of terms, such that the powers on
all possible variables are whole numbers. That is, if there is a
variable (and there doesn’t have to be), the variable must have a whole
number power or else it’s not a polynomial.*

**4.2 Operations with Polynomials** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Since polynomials may represent real numbers, polynomial functions may
be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. Polynomial functions play
an important role in business and the sciences, as many processes can be
precisely modeled using polynomial functions. For this reason, we need
to know as much about working with polynomial equations as possible.
Also, techniques learned now will be useful later, as you will see these
techniques again and again.*

**4.4 Polynomial Equations and Functions** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*Polynomials form smooth curves with no breaks or skips. Their graphs
have no breaks in them and their extremes are dominated by the highest
power term. For example, the function* ƒ(x) = 2x<sup>3</sup> +
5x<sup>2</sup> – 7x + 1 *behaves just like* ƒ(x) = 2x<sup>3 </sup>*as
the values of x become more and more positive or negative. The following
material will make it easy to understand and graph these equations and
functions.*

**4.5 Finding Roots (Solutions) to Polynomial Functions** <span
id="4.5"></span> 
*Finding the roots of any polynomial is possible, but it requires time
to master. In general, great minds came up with methods for solving
polynomials nearly 300 years ago. The methods are still useful today and
can be translated to computer programming.*

     Instructions: Review the examples, practice problems, and videos on
    the accumulated methods for finding all roots (solutions) for any
    given polynomial. The material article covers the rational root
    theorem as well as the use of synthetic division to quickly find all
    real roots. Note: Once all real roots are exhausted, what remains,
    in pairs, will be irrational roots. Methods for finding those are
    demonstrated as well. This is an accumulation of all techniques
    learned to this point. Now, consider conjugate pairs of complex
    numbers (like 2 -3i and 2 + 3i or 7 + 5i and 7 – 5i). Experiment
    with pairs of conjugate complex roots and single or odd numbers of
    complex roots. Write a one-page essay explaining why any complex
    roots of a polynomial with real coefficients *must* be in conjugate
    pairs.
