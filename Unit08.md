**Unit 8: Conic Sections** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the connection between geometry
and algebra, called conic sections, which will play an important role
when you begin the study of calculus. First, you will be introduced to
some basics, such as midpoint and distance formulas. Then, you will
begin learning certain geometric forms in algebraic expression. You will
learn to identify common forms, rewrite equations into common forms, and
extract important information, given the rewritten equations. One of the
most important methods learned in this section will be completion of
squares.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 21 hours and 15
minutes.

**8.1 Midpoint and Distance Formulas** <span id="8.1"></span> 
*Showing applications to geometry from algebra is a common procedure.
Two of the most common applications are midpoint and distance formulas.
Midpoint coordinates are nothing but the average of the x and y
components of the two points on the line segment equal distance from the
center between them. And the distance between two points is the
hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the vertical and horizontal
distances between the x and y components of those points.*

**8.2 Parabolas** <span id="8.2"></span> 
*Parabolas are formed from quadratic equations and are conic sections
that have the property that all lines that reflect off the curve are
directed at a focus. Parabolic mirrors may be used to cook, as a result
of concentrating sunlight at a single point, and parabolic antennas both
send and receive signals that can be directed from or to a particular
point within the antenna – the focus.*

**8.3 Circles** <span id="8.3"></span> 
*Circles are conic sections formed by all points a given distance from a
center point and the formula for them is an application of the
Pythagorean Theorem: x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup> or
x<sup>2</sup>/r<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>/r<sup>2</sup> = 1. r is
called the “radius” of the circle.*

**8.4 Ellipses** <span id="8.4"></span> 
*Ellipses are a general breed of conic sections to which circles are a
special case. Of the form x<sup>2</sup>/a<sup>2</sup> +
y<sup>2</sup>/b<sup>2</sup> = 1, they are oblong-shaped geometric
figures formed by points at a determined distance from two foci,
reflected across an axis. When a = b, instead of two foci, we get one
center point, and we have a circle. Ellipses are bounded by the sides of
a “box,” whose sides are formed a and b units from the center. The long
side is called the major axis and the shorter side the minor axis.*

    Ellipses”](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/conic-sections/conic_ellipses/v/conic-sections--intro-to-ellipses)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video describes ellipses relative to their
    algebraic equations, including how to complete the square to place
    them in transformational form. This shows a practical connection
    from geometry and algebra and can be used to graph an ellipse given
    its equation. Once again, the Pythagorean Theorem is used to convert
    a concept of a radius from the center of the ellipse into an
    equation.    
     Watching the video and writing notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: This interactive graph shows how an ellipse would
    have been constructed from thread, set foci, and a drawing
    implement. It also shows how an equation of a basic ellipse in
    transformational form changes if you move the foci. Note that the
    closer the foci are placed together, the more circular the
    construction becomes.  
        
     Practicing with this application and writing notes should take
    approximately 45 minutes.

**8.5 Hyperbolas** <span id="8.5"></span> 
*Hyperbolas are conic sections very similar to ellipses, in that they
have major and minor axes and are generally in the form of
x*<sup>2</sup>*/a*<sup>2</sup>*– y*<sup>2</sup>*/b*<sup>2</sup>*=
1. Instead of being bounded by a and b, a and b form a box through which
the asymptotes for the graph are diagonals of the “box,” whose sides are
formed by a and b.*

    7, Section 5: Hyperbolas”**

    Hyperbolas”](http://stitz-zeager.com/szprecalculus07042013.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: This section contains information on identifying and
    constructing hyperbolas. This includes completing the square to
    place a hyperbola in transformational form. Read pages 531–540, and
    then try the problems at the end of the section. Answers are on the
    pages that follow. After reading the article and writing notes,
    write a one-page essay on the relationship between ellipses and
    hyperbolas. How are the two related? How are they different? What
    common information helps in graphing them?  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: This interactive graph allows you to see how the
    graph (and its equation) changes if one focus or a point on a curve
    is moved. This is good practice toward linking the graph with the
    equation in your mind. It also reemphasizes the fact that a conic
    section is constructed from a relationship among the foci, the
    center, and some point.
