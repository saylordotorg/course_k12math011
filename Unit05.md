**Unit 5: Rational Functions** <span id="5"></span> 
*The first variation you will experience from polynomial functions is
the set of rational functions, which involves expressions that contain
variables in the denominator (bottom) of fractions. Such expressions
cannot accept values for denominators that cause a zero in the bottom of
any fraction. For instance, in the function f(x) = 3/x - 4 , x cannot be
equal to 4 or the expression will have a zero in the bottom. You will
learn about operations on rational functions, how to simplify rational
expressions, how to graph rational functions, and how to find solutions
of rational equations and inequalities. Finding solutions follows from
what you learn from polynomials and often requires checking the
answer(s), as some potential solutions may cause a zero in a
denominator, which cannot be allowed.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 10 hours and 30
minutes.

**5.1 Inverse, Joint, and Combined Variation** <span id="5.1"></span> 
*Rational expressions fall out of the original study of inverse, joint,
and combined variation. This is a good historical starting point for
this unit. Rational expressions have variables in the denominator of
fractions. Rate of change problems in calculus often involve rational
expressions, and these types of problems are used in many different
disciplines. For instance, in business there are rate of production
problems involving numbers of laborers that form inverse variations. In
physics, almost any problem involving the distance and gravity between
objects in space results in an inverse variation. And in chemistry,
energy equations for chemical reactions are often written as direct
variation. *

**5.2 Graphing Rational Functions** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*One of the first things we learn about fractions is that zero can’t be
in the denominator. For this reason, rational functions can be tricky,
as they may have several values that can cause zeros in denominators.
These values are called “asymptotes” and the graphs of functions at
these asymptotes may be wild. For that reason, follow the content below
and read or watch as many times as necessary, until the ideas make
sense.*

**5.3 Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions** <span

**5.4 Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions** <span
id="5.4"></span> 
*Rational expressions may only be added if the terms are written with
common denominators. We see this is true for any set of fractions that
are added. To find common denominators for rational expressions, we must
first factor each denominator and then use the factors to find a
smallest common denominator.*

**5.5 Solving Rational Equations and Inequalities** <span
id="5.5"></span> 
*Solving rational equations is fairly easy if the lowest common
denominator is used to eliminate fractions on both sides of the equation
first. Polynomial methods may be used to solve the equation once that is
done. Caution needs to be taken that the solution found does not cause a
zero in any denominator of any of the original expressions of the
equation.*

     Instructions: Read pages 301–351, and then try the problems at the
    end of the chapter. Answers are on the pages that follow. The text
    is a bit technical, but coupled with the videos and other content in
    this unit, it should become clearer. Write, in your own words, a
    clear but brief study guide on graphing rational functions. In this
    study guide, discuss how to find solutions, how to find all
    asymptotes, and then how to determine where the curves are going
    (that is, on each end, is the curve going up or down?).

     Instructions: This video discusses the basics of solving rational
    equations and emphasizes the use of the lowest common denominator to
    simplify the equation before solving. Note: Always check the final
    solution for any nonpolynomial function, as the potential answer may
    cause the equation to be undefined. Note also that this is the
    second of three videos.  
        
     Watching the video and writing notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

     Instructions: This is an assessment on understanding rational
    expressions and equations. Work all 23 problems. Answers are
    available for viewing by a button on each problem. There is also a
    link for a printed version at the bottom left of the page. Note: New
    versions of the 23 problems can be created by accessing the link in
    the upper right corner of the page. You may take a nearly unlimited
    number of attempts with different problems.  
        
     Completing this assessment should take approximately 1 hour.
