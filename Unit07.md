    change the graphs? Then change the bottom slider value to change the
    x value (input) on the exponential function. How does the x value
    relate to what is seen on the inverse as it changes? This proves
    that the log function is the inverse of the given exponential
    function. Note how the two correspond.

**7.3 Graphing Exponential and Logarithmic Functions** <span
id="7.3"></span> 
*As we have seen before, inverse functions are helpful in that once we
know the graph of one, we can easily find the graph of the other.
Exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses, so once one is
graphed, simply take the reflection across f(x) = x. That is, if (1, 5)
and (-2, 8) are on the graph of a function, (5, 1) and (8, -2) are on
the inverse.*

     Instructions: This interactive graph allows you to change various
    values and see how the changes affect the graphs of exponential and
    logarithmic functions. The first slider changes the
    contraction/expansion of the graph. The second slider changes the
    base of the functions. The third changes the asymptotes. By default,
    the log function is hidden, but a check box makes it visible. Change
    the values to see how the graphs change. Note that there is one
    shift not covered here (the “inside shift”), but that is for clarity
    on the behavior of these inverse functions.

**7.4 Common Logarithm and Base e** <span id="7.4"></span> 
*The two most widely used logarithms are common (base 10) and natural
(base e). Both flow from problems that have interested scientists for
nearly 300 years. And because powerful calculators and computers are
very recent, scientists had a need to compute large values that would
otherwise take much longer to work. Logarithms, introduced by John
Napier in the 1600s, are the means to doing these calculations quickly
and easily. Logarithms are the basis of slide rules, which were used by
engineers long before electronics made calculators feasible.*

     Instructions: Read through the page carefully and work through the

    logarithms, which have been used for large calculations for a few

    Function”](http://www.geogebratube.org/student/m12692) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This interactive graph allows you to move, stretch,
    and reflect the natural logarithmic function across the x and y axes
    and the line y = x (to show the inverse function). There are four
    sliders you can use to transform the graph: (1) “a” changes the
    coefficient of the function, which stretches or shrinks the graph;
    (2) “b” changes the internal (horizontal) shift of the vertical
    asymptote; (3) “c” changes the external (vertical) shift of the
    horizontal asymptote; and (4) “n” changes the internal coefficient.
    There are various check boxes, but the most important is the
    reflection in the line y = x, as this displays the inverse of the
    natural log function. Change the values on the slider to see how the
    graph changes. Write a study guide on transformations, using the
    knowledge you gained on this page. In particular, note what kind of
    changes requires certain actions. By going backward, that is, by
    defining the transformation you wish and then describing the action
    needed to achieve it, you will acquire a solid understanding of the
    concept.

**7.6 Solving Exponential and Logarithmic Functions** <span
id="7.6"></span> 
*Logarithms and exponents are inverses. The advantage is that you may
use that fact to solve one function by translating the problem to the
other form very easily. Logarithms have applications in such fields as
music, computing complexity, psychophysics, and forensic accounting.
Exponents feature prominently in fields such as economics, biology,
chemistry, physics, computer science, and data security. *
