**Unit 6: Radical Functions** <span id="6"></span> 

*Radical functions contain expressions under radical (nth root) signs.
For instance f(x) =<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">
</span>*<span
style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">√</span>2x+5 *is an
example of a radical function. Solving them requires raising both sides
of an equation to a power, which may create extraneous roots
(solutions). These potential solutions have to be checked, in order to
make sure one or more make the equation true. As with rational
functions, the methods for solving radical equations arise from what you
learned from polynomials. As with rational functions, the answers found
will require a check, as some potential solutions may cause untrue
statements. *

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 10 hours and 45
minutes.

**6.1 The Connection between nth Roots and Rational Exponents** <span
id="6.1"></span> 
*The connection between nth roots and rational exponents is
that <sup>n</sup>*<span
style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">√</span>*a =
a<sup>1/n </sup><sup> </sup>by definition. Exponent rules make
simplifying nth root expressions easy. There are applications of radical
equations in physics, physical chemistry, biology, and business.For
example, in biology, functions for determining population growth, given
certain factors, may be expressed as a radical equation. In physics,
equations of actions on a subatomic scale may be expressed using
radicals.*

**6.3 Compositions of Radical Functions** <span id="6.3"></span> 
*As with any function, radicals can form compositions. That is,
functions can be evaluated for other functions as well as numerical
values (i.e., we can find f(2x-1) as easily as we can find f(3)).
Caution has to be taken, however, as the domain and range of the
composition may be very different from those of the original functions
that make up the composition. In other words, always check any solutions
found to make sure they do not cause a problem in the equation, as in a
negative under a square root or a zero in a denominator.*

    Functions”](http://www.mathplanet.com/education/algebra-2/polynomial-functions/composition-of-functions)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video explains how to perform general
    composition on functions. Try working though five or six problems.
    Make sure to check the domain at the end of your work, as square
    root functions have domains limited to values that yield zero or
    positive values under the radical sign for real numbers.  
        
     Watching the video and writing notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

    real numbers.

**6.4 Inverses** <span id="6.4"></span> 
*Inverse functions are one-to-one (i.e., each x is matched to a unique y
and vice versa) and onto (i.e., every possible x matches to every
possible y). In general, if (a,b) is an element of a one-to-one
function, (b,a) will be an element of the inverse.*

**6.5 Graphs of Radical Functions** <span id="6.5"></span> 
*Graphs of radical functions are generally easy to draw. The basic
function f(x) = <sup>n</sup><span
style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">√</span>x  usually starts
at (0,0) and has (1,1) as an element. If n is odd, (-1,-1) it is also an
element. The graph gets flatter the larger n is, but all such functions
have a basic smooth curve.*

**6.6 Solving Radical Equations and Inequalities** <span
id="6.6"></span> 
*Radical equations are solvable by raising both sides of the equation to
the power of the radical. That is, to eliminate a cube root, raise both
sides of the equation to the third power. The problem is that any
solution found must be checked to ensure no negatives are caused under
even roots. Such answers are complex, and the equations we will be
solving should have real numbers solutions. *
