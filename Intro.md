The purpose of this course is to familiarize you with the fundamentals
of algebraic expressions, including adding, multiplying, factoring, and
simplifying; solving equations and inequalities; performing operations
on functions; and performing graphing and basic functional analysis.
This course is intended to extend your knowledge beyond the foundational
information learned in Algebra I and prepare you for more advanced
topics, leading toward trigonometry and calculus. Among the benefits
that you will gain from learning the material contained here are adding
tools for critical thinking, improving skill sets for use in the
sciences, and improving your competitiveness in preparation for college
applications. A strong understanding of mathematics is critical toward
earning scholarships and gaining admission to many top universities, and
the knowledge gained here will help in that regard.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Solve linear equations and inequalities.
-   Graph linear functions, polynomials, rational functions, radical
    functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions.
-   Solve systems of linear equations.
-   Solve quadratic, general polynomial, radical, rational, exponential,
    and logarithmic equations.
-   Find inverses of functions, if such inverses exist.
-   Find the results of operations on functions.
-   Graph conic sections given their equations.
-   Find the nth term of an arithmetic or geometric sequence.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
You will also need to complete the final exam.  
    
 Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your final
exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through all of the resources in each unit.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of
approximately **131 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit. It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit and then set goals for yourself. For example, unit 1 should
take approximately 23 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 7 hours and
45 minutes) on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday nights; subunit 1.2 (a
total of 8 hours and 30 minutes) on Thursday, Friday, and Monday nights,
and so forth.
