**Unit 9: Sequences and Series** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this final unit, you will be introduced to sequences and series. A
sequence is a function defined over the positive integers. A series is a
sequence in which the terms are summed. For general functions, the
domain may be any subset of the real or complex numbers, but sequences
are restricted to counting numbers. Sequences are often used to mimic
functions in complex processes and are often used in mathematical
modeling and analysis.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 10 hours and 30
minutes.

**9.1 Definition of Sequences and Series** <span id="9.1"></span> 
*Sequences are progressions of numbers that may be random but most often
are formed by patterns. They are useful in that they may be used in
programming to mimic certain functions, to which they are closely
related.*

     Instructions: This is a great description of sequences and
    recursive techniques. Sequences are often used to substitute for
    functions in some processes. Techniques for finding formulas lead to
    function creation. These techniques are used in physics and other
    natural sciences, business analysis and manufacturing, and for
    medical studies. To practice, try the randomly generated practice
    problems on the bottom of the page.

**9.4 The Fibonacci Sequence** <span id="9.4"></span> 
*The Fibonacci sequence was named for Leonardo of Pisa, called
Fibonacci, who first studied the pattern. The Fibonnaci sequence begins
with 0 and 1. Then the sequence is generated by adding consecutive
numbers to get the next term. Applications can be found in the fields of
art, engineering, botany, computer programming, and business.*

**9.5 The Sum Formula** <span id="9.5"></span> 
*The sum of terms of a sequence is called a series. Such sums can almost

a random set of numbers. This is one example, using the sum of
arithmetic sequences, which can most definitely be used to create a
formula.*
