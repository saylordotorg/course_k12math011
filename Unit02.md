**Unit 2: Linear Systems** <span id="2"></span> 
*In unit 2, you will move from simple linear equations and inequalities
to begin an exploration of more complex systems of equations and
inequalities. You will discover various methods used to solve these
equations and inequalities, in two variables. You will also learn about
linear programming. Unit 2 ends with an introduction to systems of three
equations, demonstrating that the techniques already learned may be
applied to systems of higher and higher dimension. Once you understand
the methods demonstrated, you will learn about matrices and methods of
solving systems using matrix algebra. Matrices are rows and columns of
numbers. For us, the numbers are the coefficients and constants from
linear equations. The methods used to solve these systems are extremely
helpful in later courses. You will complete the unit with an
introduction to vectors, which are rows or columns from matrices.
Learning how to use vectors is very useful in business and science.*  
    
 *Solving linear systems involves finding common points for two or more
lines. These are shared solutions among the equations, and the
techniques learned have important roles to play in solving problems in
business and science. Solving linear inequalities involves finding all
common points among the relations.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 22 hours and 15
minutes.

**2.1 Solving Linear Systems by Graphing** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*There are three possible solutions to a linear system: no point (i.e.,
no solution), single point, or infinite points. Either two lines meet at
one point, overlap (i.e., represent the same line), or don’t meet (are
parallel). We begin studying the solutions of systems by first looking
at graphs, since solutions are easier to see this way.*

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video discusses the process of solving systems
    of equations by graphing. Solving is a method for finding common
    solutions for two or more equations. Graphing is a great way to
    begin solving linear systems, since it is a visual approach to such
    solutions, making the concept easy to see. However, when the common
    solution is not made up of integer coordinates, it becomes harder to
    find graphically.

     Instructions: This video continues discussing the process of
    solving systems of equations by graphing. In this example, we see
    that not all systems have a solution. This is easier to see
    graphically than by algebra, and that is why we approach the topic
    with graphing first.

**2.2 Solving Linear Systems Algebraically** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*As with solving equations, graphs are sometimes not as useful for
systems, as the common solution may not have integer coordinates. In
this case, algebraic methods are not only more useful, but they also can
be translated to programming for computer use. Unlike graphs, you may
not be able to see which of the three solution types a system may have.
With practice, however, you may be able to tell just by looking at the
equations whether they have a solution, and if they do, whether the
solution is a single point or an entire line.*

     Instructions: This video discusses a method for solving systems of
    equations via substitution. This is another algebraic approach to
    solving systems and one we will see again in other units. This
    particular example shows that two parallel lines have no common
    solution. Now we have seen the third type of system. We have seen
    the one common point system (two lines intersecting at one point),
    the infinite common points system (two lines that are actually the
    same), and now the no common points system (parallel lines). Write a
    four-paragraph (or more) essay comparing and contrasting the
    substitution and elimination methods. What are the weaknesses and
    strengths of each method? Are there times when one has advantage
    over the other in terms of time and steps spent?  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 1 hour and 30

**2.3 Systems of Linear Inequalities** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*Linear inequalities are special cases of relations that have a lot of
application in the real world. Manufacturing, for instance, has many
examples of processes that may be modeled by systems of inequalities.
Engineering uses some systems as well. Learning how to solve these
relations is very useful.*

**2.4 Linear Programming** <span id="2.4"></span> 
*Linear programming is a special application of solving systems of
linear inequalities. In linear programming, you will learn that certain
aspects or processes have measurable constraints, and we can use those
constraints to find limits in a system (that is, the extent of our
resources limits how we may use them, and these limits form boundary
lines). We can then use corner points of the graphs of the system, using
these limits, to solve maximum/minimum problems in resource
distribution, for instance. That is, we can answer the following
question: What is the most effective use of our resources when we have
more than one way to use them? A good example is whether to use raw
materials to build cars or minivans. Linear programming can tell us the
number of each to produce to maximize revenue, based on the constraints
of the system.*

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video introduces you to linear programming,
    which is a technique often used to maximize or minimize some value.
    For instance, in this example, the instructor shows how two
    businesses maximize profits. The method begins with techniques we
    have seen for graphing linear inequalities, but instead of
    considering the shaded areas of a partial plane, linear programming
    looks at the vertices formed by the polygon created when the
    boundary lines are graphed.

     Instructions: This linear programming example shows, graphically,
    how linear programming works. It is neither extensive, complicated
    to use, nor hard to understand, but after the videos this may be a
    good, light way to view feasibility and maximization. The program
    does all the work for you, but it would be good practice using the
    skills you’ve already learned to find the equations of the
    restraints and prove that your result is truly the optimal point of
    production.  
        
     Practicing with this application and writing notes should take
    approximately 45 minutes.

     Instructions: This relatively simple interactive graph allows you
    to move a point within the region of feasibility to find an optimal
    solution. Again, this doesn’t require any computation skills on your
    part, and it is good practice as it continues to reinforce the idea
    that the optimal point is always at a vertex on the region of
    feasibility. Note: The idea of this graph is that we can use some
    gas in the car and some in the moped, but which scenario will give
    us the best total mileage if both are used?

**2.5 Systems of Equations in Three Variables** <span id="2.5"></span> 
*In real life, few problems are simple enough to be expressed with only
two variables, but the techniques we use for larger systems are just
extensions of what we have already learned. Here we look at systems in
three variables and see that solving larger systems is just a matter of
using more steps.*

**2.6 Introduction to Matrices** <span id="2.6"></span> 
*Now that we have looked at systems and have begun solving them, let us
examine them again in terms of matrices. A matrix is a mathematical
structure that has centuries of development behind it. Long before
anyone had a computer, people had to have the means to solve large
systems. As such, some of the greatest minds in mathematics sought to
find new ways to simplify these systems. Lots of theory on matrices has
led to quicker methods for solving systems based on them and has
provided us with methods that have proven easy to write in terms of
computer programming today.*

    operations. This is information used in many fields, including
    physics and engineering, manufacturing, and design and business
    decision making. Quite often, objects and processes may be created
    by transforming simpler objects. Simpler objects transformed this
    way keep many of the same properties, such as if a point on a simple
    object is to the left of another, it will remain to the left of the
    other even when the object is moved or stretched. This knowledge
    allows us to study the simpler forms first. Note: Practice problems

**2.7 An Introduction to Vectors** <span id="2.7"></span> 
*Vectors are a way to represent the rows or columns of a matrix. As with
matrices, a great deal of thought has gone into operations with vectors,
and as with matrices, we now have ways to rewrite problems using vectors
that computers can solve.*

    Vectors”](https://web.archive.org/web/20130304215316/http://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/vectors/v/linear-algebra--introduction-to-vectors)
    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This is a video on the basics of vectors with a
    graphical representation. Different operations on vectors are
    covered, including scalar multiplications (which change the length
    of a vector), adding, and multiplying.  
        
     Watching the video and writing notes should take approximately 30
    minutes.

    Link: GeoGebra: [“Addition of
    Vectors”](http://www.geogebratube.org/student/m12566) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: This is a clever, yet simple, interactive graphic
    that demonstrates visually how vector addition works. By moving the
    endpoints around for vectors **u** and **v**, you can see the
    resulting vector change. It also illustrates why adding vectors is
    sometimes referred to as the*triangle method* or the *parallelogram
    rule*. It also shows that if you want a force greater than you can
    produce straight on, you may be able to add smaller forces to
    achieve the same result.  
        
     Practicing with this application and writing notes should take
    approximately 45 minutes.
