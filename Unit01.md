**Unit 1: Linear Equations and Inequalities** <span id="1"></span> 
*You will begin Algebra II with an introduction to functions and
relations. A relation is a matching of values. For instance, the ordered
pair (2, 5) matches the value 2 with 5. An ordered triple (3,* *-1, 4)
matches the value 3 with values* *-1 and 4. A relation is a set of any
matchings of this kind. A function is a type of relation that matches
each first value with unique second and third values, and so forth. For
instance, if (2, 9) is in a function, then any other time we see 2 as a
first value in the function, it must be matched with 9 again. It is
important to note that this is strictly one way. That is (2, 9) and (2,*
*-4) can’t both be part of the same function, but (2, 9) and (3, 9) can.
Linear equations and inequalities are among the easiest to learn and
use, and they serve as a basis for the learning of more complex
functions. These functions are called linear because they graph as
straight lines.*  
    
 *In this section, you will become familiar with linear expressions,
equations, and inequalities. There are several different ways to write
the same equation, and you will learn the different forms and why each
is important, as well as how and when to use each form. Additionally,
you will learn how to change one form into another, and you will also
learn various ways to graph lines. Once you master, you will learn how
to use this knowledge to solve and graph linear inequalities. You will
learn how to graph an inequality based on a comparison test, once the
inequality is in slope-intercept form, and based on the use of test
coordinates. The importance of using test coordinates becomes clearer
later, as you use similar techniques throughout the remainder of your
mathematics courses. You will complete this unit by learning how to
solve absolute value equations and inequalities, which are just
variations on linear equations and inequalities.*

**1.1 Relations and Functions** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*This subunit concerns mathematical relations and functions. At its
core, a relation is just a set of matchings of two or more values. It
does not matter if multiple values are matched to one value. Functions
are a special case of relations. For every first value (x), only one
value (y) may be matched. That is, (2, 5) and (2, -3) may both be part
of the same relation, but (2, 5) and (2, -3) cannot both be part of the
same function. That is, if (2, 5) is part of a function and 2 is matched
again, it must be matched to 5 again for the relation to meet the
definition of a function. Subunit 1.1 provides a lot of information on
relations and functions.*

**1.2 Linear Equations** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*Lines are the first exposure to actual algebraic functions that most
students see. Linear functions are special cases of polynomial functions
(which we will see later in the course). We study lines first because
many of the things we can demonstrate with functions, such as
translation forms for graphing and solutions of equations, can be shown
in an easy-to-understand way with linear functions.*

     Instructions: This interactive graph has a wealth of information to
    it. It allows you to change the slope and y-intercept with slide
    bars to see how other values and the graph change. For an
    explanation of some of the items seen, “A” is the y-intercept, “B”
    is the point on the line when x = 2, “a” is the standard form of the
    line, “f(x)” shows the slope-intercept form, and “m” is the slope.
    Note: You can only change the slope and y-intercept with this
    application. Find the blue slope line legend in the middle of the
    graph. Slide the circle left and right to see how the line changes
    when the slope is 1 or -1. Change the y-intercept to see how the
    equation and graph change, as well. Makes notes on how the slope and
    y-intercept affect the graph of a line.  
        
     Practicing with this application and writing notes should take

     Instructions: This interactive graph allows you to change the slope
    using a slide bar or to move a point around to see how the
    point-slope form of a line changes, as well as the graph. It’s a
    great way to link the point-slope form visually with the graph.
    Note: Slider 1 changes the slope in 0.5 unit increments. Slider 2 is
    simply 0 or 1 (that is, true or false). If you wish to see the
    slope-intercept form of the equation in point-slope form, slide to
    1. If not, slide to 0.

**1.3 Linear Inequalities** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*The first practical relationships to which we are introduced are linear
inequalities.* Practical *in this case means they have real-world
applications. We study linear equations first, since many of the
techniques used to solve inequalities are extensions of solving
equations. Ironically, graphing is sometimes not very useful in solving
equations, since any real number can be a solution and it is hard to
plot some decimals. On the other hand, graphs of inequalities are very
handy for solving equations, as the solution sets are parts of planes
rather than a point on a line. We can’t list all the points in an
inequality, but we can graph them.*

     Instructions: This interactive graph allows you to change the
    y-intercept and slope to adjust the line and change from ≤ to ≥in
    order to affect the shading. This is good practice for using the
    comparison method of solving inequalities. Note: the boundary
    equation follows the left side of the line around as the slope and
    intercepts change. The possible slopes change from ­10 to 10 and the
    possible y-intercepts from -15 to 15.  
        
     Practicing with this application and writing notes should take

**1.4 Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities** <span
id="1.4"></span> 
*Absolute value equations and inequalities are the second type of
functions and relations, respectively, to which most students are
exposed. For now we will concentrate on the linear forms, and we will
see that, once again, solving them tends to involve extensions of
solving linear equations. Also, studying the graphs of linear absolute
value equations is priceless for studying reflections, stretching,
compressions, and shifts of basic graphs. Absolute value equations are
very easy to write in translation form (the form that shows how to take
a basic function, such as f(x) = |x|, and shift it left or right, up or
down; reflect across the x-axis, etc).*

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video continues the concept of absolute value
    inequalities. This example is important, for it demonstrates that
    not all equations have a solution. This is the first time we are
    introduced to the idea of checking the solution. That is, we see
    that only one solution is possible, but that potential solution
    creates an untrue statement when substituted back for the variable
    in the original equation. As we move forward, it is advisable to
    begin checking all answers.  
        
     Watching the video and writing notes should take approximately 15
    minutes.

     Instructions: This interactive grid allows you to drag an
    inequality to an area next to corresponding interval graphs. Once
    you are ready, you can check your answers to see how many are
    correct. This is good practice toward finding the solutions of
    inequalities in one variable.  
        
     Practicing with this application and writing notes should take
    approximately 45 minutes.
