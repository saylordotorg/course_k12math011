**Unit 3: Quadratic Equations and Functions** <span id="3"></span> 
*You have now been introduced to linear functions. Starting with unit 3,
you begin to find solutions for functions that form curves rather than
lines. Unit 3 covers solutions of quadratic functions (which have
variables of power 2, but no higher), beginning with graphing. Then, you
will consider solving by factoring. One issue that arises with quadratic
(and higher powered) functions is the possibility of complex or
imaginary solutions. That is, the solutions may have “i” in them, where
i = *<span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">√<span
style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1</span></span>*.
You are familiar with real numbers up to this point, but you may not
have worked with so-called imaginary numbers. Although complex numbers
(which have a real part added to an imaginary part, such as 3 – 2i)
cannot be found among real numbers, the uses of complex numbers are many
and varied. In fact, if you wear glasses, chances are imaginary numbers
played a role in the shaping of your lenses. The remainder of the
discussion of quadratic functions focuses on methods for finding
solutions, real or complex. You will end the unit with an introduction
to quadratic inequalities.*  

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take approximately 14 hours and 15

**3.1 Graphing Quadratic Functions** <span id="3.1"></span> 
*Quadratic functions are usually the next type to which students are
introduced. They are symmetrical across a vertical line through the
function’s vertex (which is the highest or lowest point on the curve)
and are easy to rewrite in translation form (which will be discussed
later in this unit). Once in translation form, they are easy to graph.*

**3.3 Solving Quadratic Functions by Graphing** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*As with linear functions, quadratic equations are solved when the
function intersects the x-axis, which is also the y = 0 line (take a
look at a typical coordinate grid and you’ll see this fact). While not
always practical, if the solutions have noninteger values, graphs of
parabolas are interesting in that they cross the x at one point (if the
vertex is the only thing touching the x-axis), at two points (if the
vertex is above or below the x-axis), or at no points (if the curve is
entirely above or below the x-axis).*

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video shows the process of solving quadratic
    functions by completing the square. Rather than using the graph to
    find solutions, you will learn how to use the technique directly to
    solve functions. For your personal study, write a one-page (or more)
    essay describing how completing the square can help when a quadratic
    function cannot be easily factored.

**3.4 Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*When we solved linear equations algebraically, we used equation
properties to reduce the equation to “x = ….” That is we had x, by
itself, on one side of the equation, and some value on the other. This
is the value of x that caused y = 0, and the solution as a point was in
the form (x, 0). It is not so simple with quadratic equations but
requires only an additional step or two. First, set the equation equal
to 0, factor, and then set each factor equal to 0 to solve. While this
method is not as visual as graphing, you can more easily find a precise
solution this way.*

     Instructions: This page contains an application of the process of
    solving by factoring by grouping, which is demonstrated in a video
    in the previous link. It sometimes takes more steps to factor but
    often is more reliable, and faster, since a factoring can be
    achieved in a straightforward method – if factors actually exist.
    You will determine whether they exist more quickly, too. To use this
    resource, try writing the problem out on paper and working
    step-by-step. Use the check boxes to see the steps done by the
    teacher. Make sure you understand the steps before proceeding. It
    may help to write notes below or in the margin of your paper by each
    step. Compare your steps to the ones the teacher provides. Are they
    similar? Did you combine one or more steps? You may try other
    examples by clicking on the “Give me a new problem” button – try at
    least three! Note: The first step in solving a quadratic equation is
    always to set the equation equal to zero and the expression in
    descending order (largest powered variable term to smallest).

**3.5 Complex Solutions** <span id="3.5"></span> 
*When the parabola never touches the x-axis, there is no way to find a
real number solution. In such a case, the only solutions possible are
complex numbers (that is, have an a + bi form, where i = *<span
style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;">√</span><span
style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">-1</span>*). We will
quickly discover that we cannot factor a quadratic equation when it has

**3.6 Solving Quadratic Functions by Using Square Roots and Completing
the Square** <span id="3.6"></span> 
*Completing the square is a process using equation properties to reach a
perfect square trinomial (three-term polynomial) on the side of the
equation. But what is interesting is that completing the square is often
used to rewrite conic sections (circles, ellipses, parabolas, and
hyperbolas) in transformation form, which makes them easier to graph.
Pay close attention to the process of completing the square. It is not
difficult but requires taking time when first exposed to it. Once
mastered, it becomes a critical element in the process to graph many
types of functions.*

    using the quadratic formula, and solving by completing the square.
    What are the strengths and weaknesses of each method? When is the

    values under the square root will be negative.

     Instructions: This page shows step-by-step instructions on solving
    quadratic equations by completing the square. This application is
    very unique; not only does it guide you through the steps, but it
    allows for interaction by using sliders on the third and fourth
    steps to find the right square term and the correct h term [for (x ±
    h)<sup>2</sup> ] to complete the square. Note: The sliders,
    especially on the step to complete the square, are a little
    sensitive, so make sure to move them slowly. They will stop when the
    correct value is reached. What I especially like about this
    application is that it finishes with the final solution set, in set
    notation. We often forget that we are dealing with number sets in
    mathematics (domains, ranges, solutions, etc.), and it is refreshing
    to see the fact that the proper way to express a solution is in set
    form.  
        
     To use this application, write the problem out on paper and work
    step-by-step. Use the check boxes to see the steps done by the
    teacher. Make sure you understand the steps before proceeding. It
    may help to write notes below or in the margin of your paper by each
    step. Compare your steps to the ones the teacher provides. Are they
    similar? Did you combine one or more steps? Click on the “Give me a
    new problem” button to try more problems. Try as many examples as
    you need to feel comfortable with this process.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 45 minutes.

**3.7 Solving Quadratic Functions by Using the Quadratic Formula** <span
id="3.7"></span> 
*The quadratic formula is perhaps the second most well-known formula in
mathematics, after the Pythagorean Theorem. The purpose of the formula
is to allow the user to find solutions to any quadratic equation simply
and easily. The quadratic formula can be derived by completing the
square on the standard form of a quadratic equation (y =
ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c). There is a bonus: It does not matter whether
there are two solutions, one solution, or no solutions. In fact, we can
tell a lot about the nature of a quadratic equation’s solutions by just
looking at the simplified value under the square root (b<sup>2</sup> –
4ac). If positive, there are two real roots. If zero, there is only one.
If negative, the two roots are complex.*

     Instructions: This page allows you to see how to solve quadratic
    equations by using the quadratic formula. It begins with two steps
    explaining that the equation must be set = 0 first, by adding
    opposites to both sides. Then you identify a, b, and c in the
    simplified equation, plug them into the formula, and use order of
    operations to simplify the solutions.

**3.8 An Introduction to Quadratic Inequalities** <span
id="3.8"></span> 
*As with linear forms, there are quadratic inequalities as well. And as
with lines, graphing quadratic inequalities remains the quickest way to
find a solution set. The reason is very similar. As with lines, it can
be harder to find a solution by graphing an equation, but solutions of
quadratic inequalities are half-planes, either above or below the curve.
In this case, it is harder to find the set notation than to find the
graph of the solutions.*

     Instructions: These pages contain information on solving quadratic
    functions, including completing the square. You solve the equation
    first, to find the “end points” of the solution intervals (the range
    of values that solve the inequality). Read pages 215–219, and then
    try the problems at the end of the chapter. Answers are on the pages
    that follow.  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.
